# EVerest - MODBUS 

This is an (not fully done) implementation of the MODBUS communication protocol.

All documentation and the issue tracking can be found in our main repository here: https://github.com/EVerest/everest

### Getting started 

The easiest way to build the project is with CMake. In order to execute the examples, make sure you are in the root folder and execute:

```
cmake -S . -B build/
make -C build
```

After this is done, the examples should be compiled and saved into the build folder.
